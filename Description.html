    <h2><em>What is H<sub>2</sub>S?</em></h2>

    <p style="font-size:16px">
        Hydrogen sulfide H<sub>2</sub>S is a colourless gas with the characteristic smell of “rotten egg” at low
        concentrations.
        The gas is known as the “silent killer” as it is extremely flammable and toxic. H<sub>2</sub>S is produced in
        numerous
        industries, such as mining, oil and gas refining and paper processing. In addition, the gas also occurs
        naturally in volcanoes, sewers, oil and gas wells and well water [1].
    </p>

    <h2><em>What is RAS?</em></h2>

    <p style="font-size:16px">
        Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) are land-based aquaculture facilities where fish are farmed in tanks
        where the water is recirculated. The use of RAS gives control over many parameters that play a part in fish
        welfare, such as pH, temperature and dissolved oxygen, and RAS thus has potential in maintaining high fish
        health. In Norway, these facilities are used for both producing food fish and rearing smolt. Since we are a
        nation where fish farming is a vital industry, it is important that these facilities perform optimally.
    </p>

    <h2><em>Why is H<sub>2</sub>S a problem in RAS?</em>
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size:16px">
        The RAS sector is currently facing the problem of hydrogen sulfide toxicity, which is harmful to fish, and in
        some cases results in acute fish death [2]. H<sub>2</sub>S production occurs when sulfur bacteria in the tank
        forms biofilm where the environment is anaerobic. Should H<sub>2</sub>S toxicity lead to fish death in RAS
        facilities, it goes without saying that the resources put into rearing the fish go to waste. Even if death does
        not occur, the stress of H<sub>2</sub>S poisoning over time decreases fish welfare.
    </p>

    <h2><em>Non-optimal detection systems</em></h2>

    <p style="font-size:16px">
        Industry stakeholders report that sensors available today do not have sufficient sensitivity, or are not
        reliable to detect the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>S before it reaches a toxic level. The ones that do
        have some level of reliability are very expensive, and it is therefore a high threshold for companies to invest
        in such a sensor.
    </p>

    <h2><em>Our solution</em></h2>

    <p style="font-size:16px">
        We propose SulFind as a solution, a biosensor that will have high sensitivity to H<sub>2</sub>S, and offer
        continuous monitoring. Our sulfide sensor will work as an alarm-system when the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>S
        is
        approaching a toxic level. If H<sub>2</sub>S levels are monitored, RAS facilities can increase the inflow of
        water when H<sub>2</sub>S
        levels rise, diluting the water and preventing disaster from striking. Therefore, a sensor may be used
        preemptively against H<sub>2</sub>S poisoning. It is however important to note that the most important
        preventative measure against H<sub>2</sub>S is tank cleanliness. Our sensor should not be used in lieu of proper
        tank cleanliness, but rather as an additional measure to combat H<sub>2</sub>S in RAS.
    </p>

    <h2><em>Why use synthetic biology?</em></h2>

    <p style="font-size:16px">
        Although there are other solutions to the H<sub>2</sub>S toxicity, these have proven to be insufficient in
        regards to both the industry’s wishes and needs. With synthetic biology it is possible to detect H<sub>2</sub>S
        at much
        lower concentration than existing methods, and therefore prevent acute fish death and profit loss. In our
        proposed implementation the biosensor will never be in direct touch with neither fish nor humans, and with the
        correct biosafety measures this biosensor should be ethically responsible.
    </p>

    <h2><em>What we strive towards</em></h2>

    <p style="font-size:16px">
        In our iGEM project, we aim towards successfully designing a biological system that detects sufficiently low
        concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>S to prevent acute fish death. Furthermore, our goal is to embed this biological
        system onto
        a microfluidic chip that will be implemented in a RAS facility. Besides our technical aspirations, we strive
        towards contributing to a more sustainable fish farming sector where fish welfare is maintained. If our project
        succeeds, we hope our contribution provides more favorable conditions for land based fish farming.
    </p>

    <h2><em>External influence</em></h2>

    <p style="font-size:16px">
        Since Norway is the second largest exporter of fish and seafood, it was natural for us to look towards the fish
        farming sector to find our problem. After meeting with several researchers at Norwegian universities such as
        NTNU and UiB (University of Bergen), we gained insight into the problems H<sub>2</sub>S causes in RAS facilities
        and the
        need for a biosensor. Further contact with stakeholders within the industry confirmed this insight, and heavily
        influenced us to try to solve this particular problem.
