        <p>
            This page contains our day-to-day work in the laboratory. As we worked on two approaches for the main part
            of the
            summer, the documentation of the laboratory work is divided into the <em>Heme protein approach</em> and the
            <em>Sulfide-responsive transcriptional repressor approach. </em>In the fall of 2021 we performed work
            related to
            <em>Improvement of an existing part.</em>
