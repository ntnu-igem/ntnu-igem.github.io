<h3>Design rationale</h3>

<p>
    Our project design affected which part we ended up with and how we improved it. One of our initial project
    approaches included using a whole-cell sensor in a microfluidic chip that would detect H<sub>2</sub>S in the
    water that moves across the sensor. In this environment, the cell would be in near hypoxic conditions which
    would require a signal generator that would work without reliable access to molecular oxygen so that we could
    detect activity via its fluorescence signaling.
