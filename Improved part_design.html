Design rationale
    <p>
        Our project design affected which part we ended up with and how we improved it. One of our initial project
        approaches included using a whole-cell sensor in a microfluidic chip that would detect H<sub>2</sub>S in the
        water that moves across the sensor. In this environment, the cell would be in near hypoxic conditions which
        would require a signal generator that would work without reliable access to molecular oxygen so that we could
        detect activity via its fluorescence signaling.
