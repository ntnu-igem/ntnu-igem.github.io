    <p style="font-size:16px">
        In our education and communication work we spoke with local highschool students about synthetic biology and
        discussed the uses and implications of the emerging technology. In addition, we engaged with the Norwegian
        aquaculture sector concerning the possible applications of synthetic biology within the sector. We developed the
        learning activity Build-A-Bac to allow students an intuitive and hands-on introduction to genetic engineering of
        bacteria, and used the game at Researcher’s night, and a school visit. Furthermore, we attended AquaNor, the
        world's largest aquaculture exhibition, and received publicity in several Norwegian aquaculture newspapers. We
        also reached out to the public by posting regular updates regarding our project through our social media
        platforms.
    </p>
    <h2 style="font-size:23px">Build-A-Bac</h2>
    <p style="font-size:16px">
        Build-A-Bac is an interactive learning activity designed to give students a hands-on introduction to the world
        of genetic engineering: how molecular tools may be used to cut apart DNA, ligate the DNA together to form
        plasmids, and transform bacteria using the plasmids, thus resulting in changed characteristics in the bacteria.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:16px">
        Build-A-Bac is aimed towards Norwegian first and second year highschool students, who have had some genetics in
        science class and are familiar with <em>genes</em>, <em>DNA</em>, <em>bacteria</em>, but who are not
        particularly familiar with the concepts of synthetic biology or genetic engineering.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:16px">
        Build-A-Bac is meant to illustrate that bacteria may be engineered by taking up plasmids, circular packets of
        DNA, and that these plasmids may be created by combining genes of interest. The game includes 3D-printed gene
        pieces that are designed so that four pieces fit together to form a circle, representing a plasmid. The students
        can then build their own plasmid with four genes to engineer their bacteria, giving it traits that will help it
        thrive in a given environment.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:16px">
        <strong><em>Note</em></strong>: The word “gene” is in this setting being used in its broadest definition,
        meaning a hereditary unit that is responsible for one characteristic. This was done to better explain the
        concept of genetic engineering to students who are unfamiliar with the concept of genes.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:16px">
        Many of the characteristics being denoted a “gene” in Build-A-Bac would in reality be encoded by multitudes of
        genes.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:16px">
        A detailed explanation of Build-A-Bac follows:
    </p>
    <h3>
        Materials:
    </h3>
    <ul style="font-size:16px">

        <li>a board with a picture of a bacterium on it

        <li>12 gene pieces of different colours and patterns

        <li>a legend describing the characteristics of each gene

        <li>environment cards

        How to play:
    </h3>
    <ol style="font-size:16px">

        <li>The students are given the board with “their bacteria”, which they must engineer to survive in a given
            environment.

        <li>2-3 environment cards are drawn and placed on the board. These cards represent the environment the bacterium
            must survive in.
            <ol style="font-size:16px">

                <li>e.g. If the CO2 and fire cards are drawn, this bacteria needs to survive an environment that is very
                    <em>hot</em>, and has an <em>abundance of CO2</em>
                </li>
            </ol>

        <li>The iGEM’er presents genetic engineering of bacteria through plasmids: Since we are scientists at our lab,
            we can use the genetic parts we have available and put them together to form a circular DNA package, a
            plasmid, giving our bacteria new abilities.

        <li>The students discuss the best combination of four genes to use in their plasmids.

        <li>Discuss the finished plasmid with the students. What characteristics does the bacteria get from this
            plasmid? Were all the requirements to the environment met? Does the bacteria have a source of energy? What
            other genes have the students decided on and why?
        </li>

    <h2 style="font-size:23px">Researchers Night</h2>
    <p style="font-size:16px">
        We had an exhibition stand at Researchers Night at NTNU in september. Researchers Night is a part of the
        “Researchers in Europe 2005” initiative, and is an annuala annualyearly event at NTNU, with the purpose of
        bringing research and the general public closer together through “edutainment” - activities that increase the
        public’s knowledge of research. The event is mostly attended by highschool students, and is a platform for
        promoting careers within research among young people<sup>[1]</sup>.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:16px">
        At the stand we spoke with highschool students and teachers about biotechnology, the field of synthetic biology,
        and how we had applied synthetic biology with our work on our iGEM project. Many of the students were interested
        in pursuing an education within science, and wanted to learn more about the applications of synthetic biology.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:16px">
        At the stand we invited students to engineer their own bacteria using the SulFind original game Build-A-Bac.
        Before beginning the activity, students were informed that when working with GMMs, safety precautions must be
        taken, and were invited to put on lab coats, glasses, and gloves. This both provided the students with a fun
        photo opportunity and increased the immersiveness of the experience, while also putting the spotlight on the
        importance of biosafety, and ended up opening for discussion concerning biosafety and biosecurity, as well as
        current Norwegian GMO regulations. In addition to this we had several interesting discussions with students
        concerning the choice of “genes” in their engineered bacteria. E.g. some students argued that an abundance of
        CO2 can make an aquatic environment acidic, so that a gene facilitating growth in low pH might benefit the
        bacteria, or that a metal-detecting gene might be best combined with a gene that allowed the bacteria to reduce
        metals.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:16px">
        We received feedback from students that the Build-A-Bac activity was engaging and informative, and many students
        wanted to learn more about how a bacterium may be genetically modified, and how modified bacteria are safely
        handled, after playing the game.

    <h2 style="font-size:23px">Visit at Thora Storm High School</h2>
    <p style="font-size:16px">
        In September, we also visited students in the entrepreneurship course at local high school Thora Storm vgs, and
        led one of their science classes. The students were to commence a module on biotechnology later in the school
        year, and we were invited to give an introduction to the world of DNA and synthetic biology. The students were
        in the midst of brainstorming ideas for their “youth businesses'', a part of the entrepreneurship course. We
        therefore also spoke about iGEM, and gave some insight into how we decided on solving the H2S problem in RAS
        after speaking to industry stakeholders (more on this can be read on our human practises wiki-page).
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:16px">
        The class began with a presentation held by our team members, where DNA and synthetic biology was presented
        through the examples of organisms and products that are made using synthetic biology approaches. The class was
        then divided into smaller groups, and each of our team members guided the students through a learning activity
        pertaining to synthetic biology.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:16px">
        The first activity was for students to “engineer” their own bacteria in the Build-A-Bac game. In the second
        activity the students extracted DNA from kiwi fruits using dish soap and rubbing alcohol (the protocol being
        used, as well as talking points during the procedure, is detailed further down). During the activities we had
        meaningful conversations with the students concerning applications of synthetic biology, and what possible
        ramifications might come to be if the technology is not controlled. The current GMO laws in Norway, and wherever
        they are fair or too restrictive, were also discussed by the students. In addition, students were interested in
        the opportunities in the aquaculture sector, and some students had even considered using synthetic biology for
        their youth businesses!
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:16px">
        We received feedback from the class that our presentation and activities were engaging and informative, and
        provided a good introduction to the modules on biotechnology and on the Norwegian aquaculture industry that the
        class would be starting later during the school year.
