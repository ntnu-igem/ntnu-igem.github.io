        <p>
            All our composite parts were designed to be used as hydrogen sulfide sensors. Parts BBa_K3762005,
            BBa_K3762006, and BBa_K3762007 are sensors for reactive sulfur species and must therefore be used in
            conjunction with a component that oxidises sulfide to S<sup>0</sup>, whilst Part BBa_K3762008 is a sensor
            for sulfide.
        </p>
        <p>
            All the composite parts were ordered fully synthesized from IDT as a linear sequence, and subsequently
            cloned into a pENZ004 plasmid vector using Gibson assembly, and transformed into <em>E. coli DH5-alpha</em>
            cells.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both part designs take advantage of the characteristics of the repressor protein SqrR. SqrR is a repressor
            protein that is involved in sulfide-dependent gene expression in the bacterium <em>Rhodobacter
                capsulatus</em>[1]. When no sulfide is present, SqrR binds to the Psqr promoter, inhibiting the
            expression of the gene encoding Sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR). SQR is an enzyme that oxidises sulfide
            to zero-valent sulfur (S0), which can then conjugate with multiple different nucleophiles or low molecular
            weight thiols to form reactive sulfur species (RSS) [1]. Upon reaction with a RSS, a di-, tri-, or
            tetrasulfide bond forms between two cysteine residues of SqrR, resulting in a conformational change that
            reduces its DNA binding affinity. RSS thereby functions as inducers of the genes under control of the Psqr
            promoter that is repressed by SqrR.[1]

            <strong>Hydrogen sulfide sensors to be used with a sulfide oxidising component</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Parts BBa_K3762005, BBa_K3762006, and BBa_K3762007 take advantage of the sulfide-binding properties of SqrR,
            as well as its repressor function, so as to function as a sensor for hydrogen sulfide. When RSS are present,
            reaction with SqrR induces the expression of the reporter gene. However, in order to function as a hydrogen
            sulfide sensor, the part must be used in conjugation with a component that oxidises sulfide to S0, such as
            SQR. In our project, oxidised glutathione (GSSG) was reacted with sulfide to form glutathione persulfide
            (GSSH), a RSS. This is summarized in figure 1.

            The parts consist of a fluorescent reporter gene placed under control of the Psqr promoter, sqrR, the gene
            that encodes SqrR, placed under control of a constitutive promoter, as well as biobrick ribosomal binding
            sites and terminators. Figure 2 shows the components of the composite parts.

            The main difference between the three parts is that in Parts BBa_K3762005 and BBa_K3762006, the reporter
            gene is the fluorescent protein CreiLov, whilst in part BBa_K3762007 the reporter gene is GFP. The relative
            strength of the constitutive promoters used for sqrR expression also varies, with the promoter used for
            BBa_K3762005 being relatively stronger.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was done because we wanted to test wherever the expression level of SqrR affected the sensitivity of
            the parts.

            function, so as to function as a sensor for hydrogen sulfide. The part consists of the fluorescent reporter

            When hydrogen sulfide diffuses across the cell membrane, the constitutively expressed SQR oxidises sulfide
            to S0. The oxidized S0 can then react with SqrR, inducing the expression of the reporter protein. This is
            illustrated in figure 4.
