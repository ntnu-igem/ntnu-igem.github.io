    <p>
      Fish has been an important source of food throughout history, and in the last 50 years the average person has
      almost doubled their consumption of fish and other aquaculture products (1). Keeping the fact that it is estimated
      that the world population will reach 9.9 billion people in 2050, the fishing sector will be important in the years
      to come (2). However, there are several high-profile issues land based aquaculture must overcome to support
      sustainable growth:

          <p>
            The use of RAS gives control over many parameters that play a part in fish welfare, such as pH, temperature
            and dissolved oxygen, and RAS thus has potential to maintain high fish health. However, H<sub>2</sub>S
            toxicity is an obvious hindrance to this, which decreases fish welfare. Even at H<sub>2</sub>S
            concentrations that are lower than lethal, damage may be done to the fish, and it is likely that the fish
            will become stressed.

            In Norway RAS is often used in combination with sea-based aquaculture, so that most fish spend some of their
            younger life in RAS facilities. This means that the problem of H<sub>2</sub>S toxicity extends to almost all
            Norwegian aquaculture, and thus have a large impact on the sustainability of Norwegian aquaculture.
          <p>
            Should H<sub>2</sub>S toxicity lead to fish death in RAS facilities, it goes without saying that the
            resources put into rearing the fish go to waste.
          <p>
            As a result, solving this issue would decrease the waste of resources, making the industry more sustainable
            - and RAS a more viable fish farming method both in Norway and globally.

      practises into our idea and project design.” [BIG LETTERS]

    <p>
      SulFind was originally intended to be the NTNU iGEM team for 2020. However, with the coronavirus pandemic striking
      Norway in March and our university closing its laboratories over the summer, we decided to postpone our iGEM
      participation one year. Still being in the brainstorming phase, the delay gave us the opportunity to explore our
      project idea whilst spending time engaging with stakeholders, incorporating the information we gleaned into our
      project.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>By engaging with human practises throughout our project, we were able to gain valuable insight into the
        problem of H<sub>2</sub>S toxicity in RAS facilities, incorporate our findings into our project and experimental
        design, as well as receive feedback from industry stakeholders. </em>
    </p>

    <h2>Brainstorming</h2>


    <p>
      When the NTNU iGEM team first was assembled in the winter of 2019, we leaped right into discussions about the kind
      of impact we wanted to make with our iGEM project. It soon became apparent that we were all passionate about the
      environment, and that <strong>we wanted to use our iGEM project to tackle local issues that affected the
        environment</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Living in Norway, the world's second largest exporter of fish and seafood (3), we quickly knew that we wanted to
      contribute to solving a problem in the fish farming industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went through <em>a lot</em> of brainstorming sessions with discussions of how our iGEM project could contribute
      to a more sustainable fish farming industry. During these sessions we had different activities to prompt ideas,
      talked to our supervisors, and reached out to different researchers at our university.

                  In Norway RAS is often used in combination with sea-based aquaculture. Most of the fish spend part of
                  their young life in RAS facilities before being transferred to fish cages in the sea. This means that
                  the majority of the Norwegian aquaculture industry somehow is dependent upon RAS.
                <p>
                  Water filtration is an integral part of the functioning of RAS, as compounds formed in the facility,
                  for example from bacterial processes and fish waste, accumulate in a way that would otherwise not be a
                  problem in open systems. Careful monitoring of the water composition is therefore vital to ensure good
                  water quality in RAS facilities.
                <p>
                  Hydrogen sulfide toxicity is a current hot topic in Norwegian RAS facilities, due to several cases of
                  acute fish death where elevated levels of H<sub>2</sub>S in the water was the suspected cause. Current
                  H<sub>2</sub>S-detection methods are often insufficiently sensitive to detect the low concentrations
                  that are toxic to fish.

                  During the meeting, the general workings of RAS facilities and the problem of H<sub>2</sub>S toxicity
                  was described to us.
                <p>
                  We were made aware that fish death due to H<sub>2</sub>S poisoning in RAS facilities might go
                  unreported, because some insurance companies in Norway do not cover financial losses caused by
                  H<sub>2</sub>S.
                <p>
                  So far, it is a challenge to detect H<sub>2</sub>S at low concentrations. Existing sensors with
                  somewhat sufficient sensitivity to the low levels of H<sub>2</sub>S that may harm fish are expensive.
                  Consequently, only a few RAS facilities in Norway are equipped with such sensors and it is still
                  uncertain if the sensors are sufficient.
                <p>
                  Through the project H2Salar, Lazado’s research group investigates the biological and physiological
                  consequences of H<sub>2</sub>S for Atlantic salmon. At the time, experiments to determine the
                  threshold level of H<sub>2</sub>S that is harmful to Atlantic salmon were being planned. These future
                  results were of great interest to our work, and we were delighted that Lazado was willing to share the
                  threshold value with us once the experiments concluded.

                  detection, and we thereby decided to look further into how one might make a biosensor for
                  H<sub>2</sub>S detection. For further research, Carlos provided us with the contact information to
                  several researchers at NTNU with more information about the topic.

                  Holand held a presentation detailing the specifics of how RAS facilities function.
                <p>
                  An important preventive measure against H<sub>2</sub>S poisoning is maintaining a low particle
                  concentration in the tank and in the system as a whole, which is accomplished by removing uneaten feed
                  and faeces immediately as they are formed in the tanks. ScaleAQ have designed particle traps in the
                  middle of their tanks, which keep debris from accumulating in the tank. However, H<sub>2</sub>S
                  production might still occur in the bioreactor and surrounding pipes, where there might be stagnant
                  water. Implementation of a H<sub>2</sub>S sensor at this location would therefore be beneficial.
                <p>
                  We were informed that measuring pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen and salinity in the tanks is
                  mandatory for Norwegian RAS facilities, but measuring H<sub>2</sub>S is not. Many RAS facilities forgo
                  H<sub>2</sub>S detection, which is likely because of the cost of H<sub>2</sub>S sensors.
                <p>
                  ScaleAQ does not actively measure H<sub>2</sub>S in the tanks they deliver, but focuses on other
                  preventative measures for H<sub>2</sub>S build-up. Still H<sub>2</sub>S detection and other
                  preventative measures are not mutually exclusive. Should a sensor be affordable in comparison to
                  existing systems, it would be a welcome safeguard against H<sub>2</sub>S build-up, as it would allow
                  RAS facilities to increase the inflow of fresh water to lower the H<sub>2</sub>S concentration.

                  The most important <strong>specifications a biosensor needs to be viable as a replacement for existing
                    H<sub>2</sub>S sensors in RAS were pointed out. These were high sensitivity</strong>,
                  <strong>continuous or semi-continuous monitoring (as H<sub>2</sub>S-levels can increase suddenly),
                    affordability, and possibility to handle for non-technical personnel.</strong>
                <p>
                  We discussed what it would mean to place a biosensor in a RAS facility in terms of GMO regulation and
                  biosafety. Our proposed design of testing run-off water from the tank was well received, and the team
                  at ScaleAQ stressed the importance of not returning the water to the tank after passing through the
                  sensor. Placing the biosensor externally to the fishing tanks would also minimize the risk of biofilm
                  formation that could impact the sensor.
                <p>
                  Existing H<sub>2</sub>S sensors function by measuring H<sub>2</sub>S in gaseous form or use membrane
                  technology.
                <p>
                  Should a microfluidic chip be used in a RAS facility, the water would need to be filtered or treated
                  in some way, so that larger particles would not clog the chip. Ulgenes suggested that this filtration
                  might itself be incorporated into the chip.

                  Biofilm formation in RAS facilities may pose a challenge to sensors placed in the tank. A microfilter
                  for filtering tank water before reaching the sensor was suggested. This would require workers to
                  frequently change the filter, but might still be worth it.
                <p>
                  There is a lot of skepticism surrounding the use of GMO in Norway that is rooted in opinion, rather
                  than in actual risk assessment.

                  Our initial LOC design was based on having two different chambers on the chip. The first chamber was
                  supposed to be the mixing chamber. For our SqR approach, H2S would be mixed with GSSH in an aqueous
                  state, and sent to the next chamber by channels. In the heme approach, this channel would only be used
                  as a guiding channel. The next chamber we would have immobilized <em>E. Coli </em>or heme protein.
                  When the aqueous solution passes by the immobilized biological entities, the H2S can pass through the
                  immobilization substance and bind either to heme or repressor proteins. After the fluorescence takes
                  place, it would be measured by a fluorometer.
                <p>
                  When we discussed this idea with Husnain, he told us that it would be better to exclude the
                  immobilization chamber, and instead use a flow-through solution. By then, we had set aside the
                  SqR-approach due to insufficient results. Our new design consisted of one inlet for the heme solution,
                  and two for the spacer oil. When the heme solution interacted with the oil, droplets would be created.
                  Then, by picoinjection, we would insert the H2S solution into the heme droplet. Since the reaction
                  occurs instantly, there was no need for any incubation channels. After the picoinjection the droplets’
                  fluorescence would be measured with a fluorometer.

                <p>
                  In order for a H<sub>2</sub>S sensor to be useful for the industry it needs to reliably detect

                <p>
                  Hydrogen sulfide poisoning can occur in two ways:
                <ol>

                  <li>Acute hydrogen sulfide poisoning as a result of chunks of biofilm that loosens and releases toxic
                    amounts of H2S. A sensor will not be able to prevent such poisoning as it happens too rapidly.

                  <li>Slow build up of hydrogen sulfide by leakage from biofilm over time. This can lead to fish death
                    over time and reduced fish welfare.

                    <p>
                      The most important means to prevent H2S production is good design of facilities, cleaning of tanks
                      and knowledge about water chemistry amoonguss the staff.
                    <p>
                      The problem of H2S is complex and will not be solved alone by a sensor. A sensor might be able to
                      detect the slow build up of H2S and as a result improve fish welfare. In combination with other
                      preventative methods, a sensor might help improve the RAS technology.

                  The meeting had no direct impact on our project implementation, but made us reflect about certain
                  aspects of the H2S problem.
                <p>
                  Even if our sensor worked perfectly, it would not be enough by itself. <strong>Awareness and other

                <p>
                  The RAS technology needs new and innovative solutions, and a biosensor detecting H2S is one step of
                  the way contributing to a more sustainable industry.

                  The team participated at AquaNor which is the world’s largest aquaculture technology exhibition. We
                  had our own stand together with NTNU Oceans, but also used our time to visit the other stands. During
                  the day, the team spoke with several different aquaculture companies. We learned a lot regarding
                  aquaculture technology and the needs of the industry. The Norwegian insurance company, Gjensidige
                  where Stine Egeland is employed, told us that our sensor would be very helpful for them, as they pay
                  out a lot of insurance money to RAS facilities due to H2S related issues.

      <h2>Conclusion - “close the loop”</h2>
    </center>

    <p>
      To conclude, integrating our human practises work into our project was viable for determining several aspects of
      our project design, engineering and implementation. By communicating with experts, stakeholders and the industry
      throughout the project we were able to adjust and redesign our project based on feedback loops. In addition, it
      allowed us to communicate with the fish farming community and create a solution that fulfills the needs of the
      industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      By continuously integrating human practises into our work we were also able to close the loop between our
      initial project ideas and goals, and realistic implementation in real life. Initially we wanted to remove H2S
      from the RAS facilities, but during the course of our human practises work we learned that detecting H2S is the
      first step in solving this issue, and as a result decided to focus our project on that.
    </p>
    <p>
      We want to thank all stakeholders, experts and professors for their time and insightful knowledge that
      contributed to shape SulFind. Their unique perspective opened our eyes to the complexity of the H2S-issue that
      we could not have gleaned ourselves.
