        As the famous saying goes, there is no I in team. Without the collective effort of every single team member,
        advisors, and outside sources, the project would be nothing more than a thought lost to the whims of life. This
        page is dedicated to thank each individual and group for contributing to the different aspects of SulFind.

        You can only do so much with hard work and motivation without proper finances. All of our team members
        contributed to secure the necessary sponsors so that we could aim high and pursue multiple ideas simultaneously,
        without restrictions in budget limiting us.

        Getting the word out there can be easy in the sense that technology enables us to share information instantly,
        however the true challenge lies in making our information stand out in the vast masses of the internet. This
        team worked persistently to spread the word about iGEM and SulFind through different social media platforms.

        As our project took shape, it became apparent that one of the most promising solutions to H<sub>2</sub>S
        pollution could be to integrate a biosensor in a microfluidic chip. This group worked with one of our
        accomplished advisors, Husnain Ahmed, to develop a chip to be used in H<sub>2</sub>S detection.

        While most research projects end in a black and white research paper with a limited amount of figures, iGEM
        provides a way for science and research to be illustrated creatively. Our multimedia group contributed to making
        our promotion video, project video, and Wiki layout.

        One of the most essential parts of our project was testing out the different biological parts, and handling the
        toxic H<sub>2</sub>S in the process. From cloning <em>Escherichia coli </em>to producing H<sub>2</sub>S from
        Na<sub>2</sub>S and actually testing our system designs. Our project would never reach its fullest potential
        without this group’s diligent work.

        The Peter Parker Principle (PPP for short) states “with great power comes great responsibility”. Within the
        world of synthetic biology it is therefore extremely important to think about why one does anything in a
        particular way, and if it is the most ethical action. Our HP group has worked hard to ensure that our project’s
        ethical and moral aspects were aligned with iGEM values at all times.

        The future lies within the mind of children, and it’s therefore imperative that they learn the advantages and
        disadvantages of the tools they potentially will wield. The Education group worked determinately towards
        educating children, teenagers and young adults about synthetic biology.

        Sometimes, and by that we mean all the time, we got stuck at some aspect of our project. As a third, fourth, or
        fifth year student, it’s not always easy to see the solution to the problem yourself. Therefore, we have truly
        needed every bit of advice our wonderful advisors have given us. They have given us perspective on certain
        problems, such as LOC design, lab protocols, iGEM do’s and don'ts, finding relevant research articles, and more
        or less every aspect of the SulFind project.
