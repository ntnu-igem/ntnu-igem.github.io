    <h2>Attributions</h2>
    <p>
        As the famous saying goes, there is no I in team. Without the collective effort of every single team member,
        advisors, and outside sources, the project would be nothing more than a thought lost to the whims of life. This
        page is dedicated to thank each individual and group for contributing to the different aspects of SulFind.

        You can only do so much with hard work and motivation without proper finances. All of our team members
        contributed to secure the necessary sponsors so that we could aim high and pursue multiple ideas simultaneously,
        without restrictions in budget limiting us.

        Getting the word out there can be easy in the sense that technology enables us to share information instantly,
        however the true challenge lies in making our information stand out in the vast masses of the internet. This
        team worked persistently to spread the word about iGEM and SulFind through different social media platforms.

        As our project took shape, it became apparent that one of the most promising solutions to H<sub>2</sub>S
        pollution could be to integrate a biosensor in a microfluidic chip. This group worked with one of our
        accomplished advisors, Husnain Ahmed, to develop a chip to be used in H<sub>2</sub>S detection.

    </p>
    <p>
        While most research projects end in a black and white research paper with a limited amount of figures, iGEM
        provides a way for science and research to be illustrated creatively. Our multimedia group contributed to making
        our promotion video, project video, and Wiki layout.

        <strong><em>Wet-lab - Andrea Stallvik, Tina Dahlgren, Kristine Lippestad, Elise Damlien, Eline Wålen Østerhaug,

        One of the most essential parts of our project was testing out the different biological parts, and handling the
        toxic H<sub>2</sub>S in the process. From cloning <em>Escherichia coli </em>to producing H<sub>2</sub>S from
        Na<sub>2</sub>S and actually testing our system designs. Our project would never reach its fullest potential
        without this group’s diligent work.

    <p>
        <strong><em>Human Practices - Everyone </em></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Peter Parker Principle (PPP for short) states “with great power comes great responsibility”. Within the
        world of synthetic biology it is therefore extremely important to think about why one does anything in a
        particular way, and if it is the most ethical action. Our HP group has worked hard to ensure that our project’s
        ethical and moral aspects were aligned with iGEM values at all times.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><em>Education - Martin Eide Lien, Andrea Stallvik, Kristine Lippestad, Eline Wålen Østerhaug, Elise
                Damlien, Victoria Nilsen Gjøvaag, Tina Dahlgren, Adrian Thorsplass, Anine H. Olafsen </em></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The future lies within the mind of children, and it’s therefore imperative that they learn the advantages and
        disadvantages of the tools they potentially will wield. The Education group worked determinately towards
        educating children, teenagers and young adults about synthetic biology.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><em>Project design - Everyone</em></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        All of our team members contributed to our project design. We worked together collectively as a team in order to
        come up with the project idea, design and plan the experiments and adjust the experimental design according to
        results from the laboratory.

        <strong><em>Economy </em></strong>- <em>Elise Damlien, Victoria Nilsen Gjøvaag</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        As the project and budget grew we needed a group to take care of our economy in a responsible way.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><em>Improvement of UiOslo_Norway 2020 software tool - Martin Eide Lien </em></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The software tool made by the University of Oslo’s 2020 iGEM team can be used to model fish behavior in response
        to different factors. The tool was improved with regards to user friendliness and automation of laborious steps.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><em>Collaboration</em></strong> - <em>Everyone</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Collaboration is an important part of iGEM and this team worked hard to ensure both our interests and our
        collaborating team's interests when working together.

    <p>
        <strong><em>Wiki design - Martin Eide Lien, Fanny Olivia Johannessen Berstad, Leik Lima-Eriksen</em></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        This hardworking team group constructed the design of our wiki-page from the bottom up.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><em>Wiki content</em></strong> - <em>Everyone </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        All of our team members contributed to create and document the content on our wiki-pages.

        Advisors
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes, and by that we mean all the time, we got stuck at some aspect of our project. As a third, fourth, or
        fifth year student, it’s not always easy to see the solution to the problem yourself. Therefore, we have truly
        needed every bit of advice our wonderful advisors have given us. They have given us perspective on certain
        problems, such as LOC design, lab protocols, iGEM do’s and don'ts, finding relevant research articles, and more
        or less every aspect of the SulFind project.
