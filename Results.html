        <p style="font-size:16px">
            We performed 16 experiments, which can be divided into three categories based on what variable was explored.
            This includes varying H<sub>2</sub>S concentrations, varying protein concentrations and kinetic studies
            (varying the time)
            with 2-3 parallels. All experiments involved the observation of the reaction between H<sub>2</sub>S and
            N-terminus
            Cy3-tagged myoglobin, using fluorescence intensity (FI) measurements. Additionally, two emission/excitation
            scans were performed to find the optimal excitation and emission bands for these measurements. The
            instrument
            used for all fluorescence intensity measurements was the Tecan Infinite 200Pro.

        <p style="font-size:16px">
            In the graph below are the results of experiment 1. Here we measured using 5 mg/L of labeled myoglobin-Cy3
            reaction mixture, and varying H<sub>2</sub>S concentrations around the level which is supposed to be
            unhealthy, not deadly,
            for fish in RAS. For the measurement we used the optimal excitation/emission wavelengths for our
            fluorophore,
            Cy3, which is 550nm and 570nm. As you may see, these results are fairly unpromising, as there is high
            variance
            and no discernible trend. Further, we would expect our 0-value to be the highest, as the presence of
            H<sub>2</sub>S should
            lower the fluorescence intensity of the reaction mixture. However, we got odd values for our blank wells
            (which
            is just water and buffer), at around 50000 FI, much higher than all the values for the measurement points.

        <p style="font-size:16px">
            Due to the high variance and high FI values for the blank measurements from our initial results, we
            suspected
            that the excitation/emission parameters might be too close. The instrument we used for fluorescence
            measurement
            uses a 9nm wide band for emission measurement, and a 20nm band for excitation. Since our chosen
            excitation/emission peaks for the first experiment were 550/570, the strange values might be caused by
            spectral
            overlap or poor calibration of the instrument. To investigate further we performed excitation and emission
            scans
            for the respective emission and excitation values. The results for these scans can be found in figure 2, for
            the
            excitation scan, and figure 3, for the emission scan.

            parameters were 550nm for excitation, 560-600nm in 2nm increments for emission (only 576-600nm is shown in

        <p style="font-size:16px">
            From these results, we can see that there is a large increase in fluorescence intensity when measuring
            emission
            at 570nm and exciting higher than 545nm, and likewise there is an increase when exciting at 550nm and
            measuring
            emission lower than 575nm (it is important to note that for the emission values the real area is ±4.5nm, and
            for
            excitation it’s ±10nm). For the other values we can see that the reaction mixture measurements have the
            highest
            fluorescence intensity, so ideally we want to measure in this area. Using this, we decided to measure with
            excitation/emission pairs such as 540nm/570nm, 540nm/580nm and 550nm/580nm for the next few experiments. We
            then
            saw that 540nm/580nm had the lowest variance of the three pairs, and similar results, so we then decided to
            use
            only 540nm/580nm for practical reasons. Due to this, the rest of the results will be from the 540nm/580nm
            data.

            Following our excitation/emission scans, we performed the measurements for experiment 2 using our new
            measurement parameters, and got better results. This time, our blank measurements were close to zero, our
            zero-measurements were the highest, there was lower overall variance and we got somewhat of a better trend,
            though not perfect. We used a wider range of H<sub>2</sub>S concentrations for this experiment, which at the
            higher values
            has a large molar excess over the 5 mg/L reaction mixture (around 42 times for 25 micromolar of
            H<sub>2</sub>S)

            Using the three parallels from each measurement, we set up a two tailed T-test table to study the
            statistical
            significance of the data. This is shown in table 1, and is color coded such that any value below 0.025 is a
            deep
            green, above 0.050 yellow and red towards 1. Here we can see that we have good statistical significance for
            the
            difference between the zero-measurements and 1uM measurements, as well as between zero and 5. There is
            however
            very low significance between 1uM and 5uM, which makes sense since their means are so close. Additionally,
            there
            is good significance between 5um and 10um, but in the opposite direction from what we’d prefer (increasing
            FI by
            concentration instead of decreasing).

            Due to the unwanted upwards trend towards the higher values, we speculated that the large molar excess could
            be
            over-saturating the reaction mixture, so in experiment 3 we tried using a higher mixture concentration (25
            mg/L)
            and a narrower/lower range of H<sub>2</sub>S concentrations (in the ranges that was deadly for fish in RAS).
            As you can see
            in figure 5, this did not go well. We got very high variance, no discernible trend and the zero-measurement
            wasn’t significantly higher than the measurements with H<sub>2</sub>S.

            Following these experiments, we tried investigating different protein concentrations, as well as the effect
            of
            time. In figure 8 we see the results of experiment 8, where the FI of several protein concentrations are
            shown,
            measured with three parallels at three time-points. As evident, time doesn’t seem to be a large factor in
            this
            experiment. Additionally, we can observe that the larger the protein concentration the higher the variance,
            particularly past 10 mg/L.

            To investigate the reaction with H<sub>2</sub>S further, we performed a series of kinetic experiments. These
            measured the
            fluorescence intensity of the reaction mixture with and without H<sub>2</sub>S present over a period of 30
            minutes. The
            results for one of these experiments, experiment 14, is presented in figure 9. Here we see that in the very
            beginning there is good separation between the H<sub>2</sub>S FI (blue line) and null FI (orange line), but
            this shrinks
            over time, and at about 1200s the H<sub>2</sub>S FI is in fact larger than the null FI. An important thing
            to
            note was that
            it was unexpected for the null FI to decrease at all, since this should only happen if the reaction mixture
            comes in contact with H<sub>2</sub>S. This happened in all the kinetic experiments we performed.

            Due to the strange results of the previous kinetic experiments, we decided to investigate whether the light
            from
            the fluorescence measurements could be degrading either the fluorophore or myoglobin component in the
            reaction
            mixture, leading to false readings. In experiment 16, we tried checking for this by performing several 30
            minute
            kinetic measurements, but with varying measurement intervals; 5, 30, 60 and 300 seconds. The results are
            presented in figure 10, and here it is evident that with the most frequent kinetic intervals of 5 seconds,
            there
            was a significant drop in FI compared to less frequent intervals. This is visible when comparing the 5s
            measurements the red lines) to the grouping of the other intervals’ measurements. However, even for the less
            frequent intervals the null FI is still dropping over time, and though there is better separation over time
            this
            also shrinks to close to the same FI value for many of the lines.

        <p style="font-size:16px">
            We managed to get statistically significant differences between null measurements and certain H<sub>2</sub>S
            measurements
            with our reaction mixture early on. Beyond that, however, most experiments in our project involved
            investigating
            different factors that affect the variance of our measurements, and potentially the trend between different
            H<sub>2</sub>S
            concentration measurements. Of these, we are fairly certain that light exposure is a big factor in
            determining
            FI measurements over time, which makes sense given that the fluorophore we used is light sensitive.
            Unfortunately, a lot of other important factors were harder for us to test due to our limited resources and
            instruments.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:16px">
            However, inferring from the results, we speculate that a lot of the variance could be explained by the free
            diffusion of H<sub>2</sub>S from the open wells into the air inside the fluorescence measurement instrument
            and then back
            into the null wells. Specifically, the decrease in FI of the null measurements in the kinetic experiments
            seems
            to indicate this. This speculation is based on H<sub>2</sub>S being very volatile, and air diffusion within
            a
            somewhat
            enclosed space can distribute H<sub>2</sub>S in a higher concentration effectively. The diffusion back into
            the solution in
            the null well should be less effective, but given the sensor having a low enough limit of detection it would
            explain the several lines in experiment 16 stabilizing at the same FI value over time. To check if this was
            the
            case, we would have needed a fluorometric instrument with closed and separated measurement wells .
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:16px">
            There are also some other factors that also could affect the variance. Firstly, H<sub>2</sub>S can be
            oxidized
            very easily,
            which means that in addition to the H<sub>2</sub>S lost to diffusion, there might be a substantial decrease
            in
            H<sub>2</sub>S while
            it’s in solution. To prevent this we would have needed a closed system which we would deoxygenate using a
            degasser, bubbling argon or nitrogen through. Secondly, the oversaturation of H<sub>2</sub>S in the reaction
            mixture with
            respect to a potentially linear measurement area could explain both variance and the lack of a general trend
            for
            our measurements. Myoglobin has a higher chance to irreversibly bind to H<sub>2</sub>S when it’s present in
            a
            relatively
            high concentration, which we suspect would not produce a signal (decrease in FI), and could explain the
            increase
            in FI generally at higher H<sub>2</sub>S concentrations as seen in experiment 2 and 5. To investigate this
            meaningfully
            would require us to lower the variance caused by the prior factors, since as we saw in experiment 3 and 8
            the
            variance seems to increase substantially with increasing the protein concentration.

            In order to make sure that H2S was produced in the prepared solutions of Na2S, we used the methylene blue
            method. Using this method, we observed a colour change to blue, verifying the presence of H2S. We could
            therefore rule out a lack of H2S production as a source of error in our experiment.

        <p style="font-size:16px">
            In summary, although we have some results indicating the potential for an H<sub>2</sub>S sensor with a very
            low level of
            detection, the variance and lack of trend in important ranges severely inhibit the sensor performance in
            other
            areas. We however note that improvement may only require better suited hardware. As our proposed
            implementation
            would be in an LOC, some of the factors affecting variance might be diminished, such as the H<sub>2</sub>S
            diffusion
            between measurement wells.

            The five constructs ordered from IDT were cloned into plasmid vectors by Gibson assembly. Next, the plasmids
            were transformed into supercompetent <em>Escherichia coli </em>cells. Sanger sequencing was used to verify
            if
            the cloning had been successful. Four out of five designs came out successful.

            The plasmid vector, pENZ004, was PCR amplified with primers containing overhangs corresponding to the ends
            of
            the constructs. Since some of the constructs were identical on either side, three plasmid amplifications
            were
            made. The PCR gel analysis, shown in figure 1, showed that all three plasmids had been PCR amplified, to the
            desired length (ca 2.1 kb).

            The next step was to test the whole cell sensors. Design 1 was tested with GSSH produced from GSSG and
            specific
            concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>S. Design 2 was tested with H<sub>2</sub>S directly. Exact concentrations and

            When exposing the whole cell sensor to GSSH (design 1) and H<sub>2</sub>S (design 2) the intensity of the
            fluorescence signal was expected to increase with increasing H<sub>2</sub>S concentration. Unfortunately,
            none
            of the whole cell sensors showed a fluorescence signal when observed under fluorescent light, see figure 2,
            or
            when fluorescent was measured on a Tecan plate reader, see figure 3.

            As detailed on our
            <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:NTNU-Trondheim/Engineering" target="_blank">engineering page</a>
            it was discovered that mistakes made during the ordering of our constructs resulted in the CreiLov gene
            being
            inserted without a start codon. In addition, the ribosome binding site sequence was inserted twice and
            inverted,
            likely disturbing translation of the constructs. It is also a possibility that the cell membrane is
            impermeable
            to GSSH due to the size of the molecule.. To improve the approach, an in vitro kit could be utilized. The
            boundary of the cell membrane would then be eliminated. If time had permitted we would have liked to fix
            these
            mistakes and study the approach further. Read more about this on our <a
