        <h2>Build-A-Bac</h2>


        <p>
            Our educational work resulted in several elements that we used during the school visit and at the stand at
            Researcher’s Night. One of these is Build-A-Bac. We are adamant that Build-A-Bac can be adopted by future
            iGEM teams and be incorporated in their educational approaches. We implore future adopters to modify
            Build-A-Bac to their specific needs and target groups. Modifications can be to increase complexity, include
            more elements that are needed for a plasmid to work and extend the list of genes that players can choose.

            Below is a link to a .zip file with everything that we used to create Build-A-Bac in english, including
            premade paper cutouts for genes as an alternative for 3D printing.

        <h2>Improvement on UiOslo_Norway 2020’s software tool</h2>


        <p>
            We improved upon the user friendliness and automation of UiOslo_Norway 2020’s software tool. This included
            simplifying and clarifying the readme file and code comments, as well as removing several manual steps in
            the visualization pipeline by adding calls to Blender’s Python package (bpy).
        </p>
        <p>
            We simplified the use of the tool such that the only step needed is to start the script in the scripting
            tab. This removes the manual steps that were previously required. We achieved this by automating the step of
            importing 3D objects and deleting the default created cube inside blenderScript.py. We believe this lowers
            the adoption threshold of this software to future users as well as removing repetitive steps.
