    <p style="font-size:16px">
        Collaborations and transparency in science are core values in the iGEM community. In science little to nothing
        can be achieved by the means of one. However, in an environment where one can interact, discuss and collaborate,
        science can thrive, accelerate and blossom.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size:16px">
        The SulFind team interacted with several iGEM teams through different collaborations, all of which were
        rewarding in terms of contributing to other team’s success, as well as our own. All of our collaborations are
        listed below.

    <p style="font-size:16px">
        In the fall of 2020 we participated in an ethics workshop with several 2020 iGEM teams. The workshop dealt with
        several ethical dilemmas in the iGEM world. Amongst other things, we discussed the risks of using GMO, disposal
        of biosensors and sustainable production of biosensors. We also got feedback on our project idea.The teams
        participating were the 2020 Aalto Helsinki team, Stockholm team, Uppsala Team and the Copenhagen team. The
        workshop was beneficial for our project as we got valuable feedback on our project and got the opportunity to
        reflect on important issues related to our project.

    <p style="font-size:16px">
        The SZU-China team reached out to us in July 2021 about translating a children’s game to norwegian. The game is
        called IntestiNO, and is a UNO-like board game meant to educate children about intestine flora and health in a
        fun and engaging way. This was something we really wanted to do, so we said yes and did our best to enable
        Norwegian children to learn in a fun style!

    <p style="font-size:16px">
        We participated in iGEM TU Darmstadt’s paper plane challenge on instagram in july. The challenge was to catch a
        paper plane, transition to a laboratory coat, and then throw it. The TU Darmstadt team collected videos from
        iGEM teams all over the world and assembled them into one video. In addition to being really fun, the challenge
        shed a light on all the different locations iGEM teams are working from, and gave us a sense of being part of
        the iGEM community.

    <p style="font-size:16px">
        In the summer of 2021 the iGEM Düsseldorf team invited us to join the postcard project. The idea of the postcard
        project was to design a postcard with a description of our project and a related picture. The Düsseldorf team
        then collected all of the postcards, and in return sent them out to other iGEM teams all over the world. This
        project was really cool and inspiring as we got the chance to spread knowledge about our own project, as well as
        learn about the projects of other iGEM teams!

    <p style="font-size:16px">
        We were nominated by iGEM Team Lund to participate in the instagram monument challenge of iGEM GO Paris-Saclay.
        The challenge was simple: to take a picture in front of a characteristic building in our city and post it with
        the hashtag #igemmonumentchallenge. We thought this was a fun, creative idea and decided to join in! We chose to
        take the picture in front of the cathedral Nidarosdomen, as it is one of the most popular attractions in
        Trondheim and an important part of Norwegian history.

    <p style="font-size:16px">
        The iGEM Aix Marseille team invited us to participate in the instagram Emoji game. The game was to send a
        screenshot of some emojis we would use to describe our project. The iGEM Aix Marseille team used the emojis to
        make a game for guessing projects based on the emojies. We thought this challenge was quite fun and wanted to
        contribute!

    <p style="font-size:16px">
        We are also going to Brussel the 11.-15. november with iGEM teams from Thessaly, Helsinki and Leuven. In Brussel
        we are planning to visit biotechnology companies, explore the city, get to know the other iGEM’ers and their
        projects and watch the Giant Jamboree together!
