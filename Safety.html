    <h2 style="color: var(--color-8);font-size:23px;text-align:center">Overview</h2>


    <p style="font-size:16px">
        Early on in our iGEM cycle, we began the process of ensuring adequate safety regarding our project design and
        our own safety when working in the lab. Eventually we ended up with a design that does not contain any living
        organisms, thus dramatically reducing the risk of escaping and interference with the environment. Before
        finalizing the project design and moving away from living organisms, we used <em>E. Coli </em>strains that are
        in risk group 1 to not endanger humans and the environment unnecessarily.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2 style="color: var(--color-8);font-size:23px;text-align:center">Safety on Project Design</h2>


    <p style="font-size:16px">
        As one of our two candidate designs consist of modified<em> E. coli</em> cells, there is always the risk of the
        modified bacteria escaping the lab and interfering with the environment. Therefore we very carefully followed
        all regulations regarding work with recombinant DNA and GMO whilst working with the design involving living
        cells. However, our final design utilizes non-living heme proteins. This reduces risks tremendously as compared
        to using living organisms in the design. Proteins are easier to contain in the lab, as they are unable to
        replicate and spread in the environment like bacteria. By choosing protein instead of bacteria, we provide
        ourselves with more control.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:16px">
        Furthermore, when working with living cells we chose <em>E. coli </em>strains DH5a, and BL21, which are in risk
        group 1. This way, risks concerning the host organism are reduced. For this design we also chose GFP which emits
        fluorescence and hence is a non-harmful reporter gene. The probe we used in our final design, Cyanine3 NHS
        ester, also emits fluorescence and is a non-hazardous chemical.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:16px">
        Our final design will be embedded on a microfluidic chip. This produces a strictly controlled system, where we
        accurately control what is passing in and out of the tubes on the chip. It allows us to directly and safely
        collect the waste leaving the chip and dispose of it in a correct and secure manner. In addition, the use of a
        lab-on-a-chip means working with concentrations on nano scale. This reduces risks related to project design,
        because if an accident were to occur, the amount spilled would be very little compared to having a project
        design on macro scale.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: var(--color-8);font-size:23px;text-align:center">Safety in the Lab</h2>


    <p style="font-size:16px">
        As we were lucky enough to execute actual lab work this year, we wanted to make sure that all necessary safety
        precautions were put into place when it comes to our lab work. First of all, we all underwent safety training
        before gaining access to the Molecular Genetics and Microbiology (MolGen) lab at our university. Since this lab
        is certified for risk 1 and 2, there are several obligatory activities you must do first. These activities
        consist of an online lab course followed by an online lab exam, and a guided tour in the lab where you must
        perform several activities like sorting lab equipment before their waste disposal. After our initial safety
        training, we got thorough tutorials on lab equipment by trained personnel in the lab, to ensure that we used
        equipment properly.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:16px">
        As stated in the MolGen lab guidelines, we wore PPE at all times and had extra safety measures when working with
        hydrogen sulfide. None of us ever worked alone, and when dealing with (H<sub>2</sub>S) we worked under a fume
        hood. All
        hazardous waste was collected and disposed of according to university guidelines.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:16px">
        To ensure that no accidents happened at the lab, we made thorough lab protocols for all of our experiments.
        These protocols can be found <span style="text-decoration:underline;">here</span>. Lastly, we did a detailed
        risk assessment for our lab’s supervisor.
